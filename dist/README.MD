## Description
The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell) Everything that can be invented has been invented. (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents, 1899) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich)
